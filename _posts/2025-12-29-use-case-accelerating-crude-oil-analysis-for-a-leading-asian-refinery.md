  At one of Asia's largest energy companies owning several refineries, the R&D
  analysis team is responsible for evaluating hundreds of crude oil feedstocks
  each day, which directly influence each refinery efficiency and profitability.
  As expected, their laboratory environment is highly technical, regulated, and
  accuracy-driven, yet the reality of conventional crude oil assays had become a
  persistent operational bottleneck. 


  A full crude assay - covering physio-chemical properties and multiple
  distillation fractions – still required **several weeks to months to
  complete**, as per the current industry standards. 


  It’s impossible for refineries to wait for laboratory assay results before
  making purchasing or blending decisions. Today, these decisions rely on a
  mathematical optimization model that estimates which crude oils to buy based
  on factors such as crude price, composition, expected product values, and
  operating costs. A crucial input to this model is the crude’s physicochemical
  profile and its distillation yields. 


  When real assay data is unavailable, companies rely on estimated values
  derived from historical information - but these estimates are often generic
  and highly inaccurate. For example, properties such as API gravity (see image
  1) can vary significantly depending on season, well evolution, and
  shipment-to-shipment differences, and many other key parameters show similar
  variability.

  As a result, the model’s recommendations are only approximate, meaning that
  purchasing and blending strategies are often suboptimal. This is why accurate,
  near–real-time crude measurements are essential; refineries simply cannot wait
  two months for traditional assay results. The need for faster, reliable crude
  oil evaluation was clear.


  ## The Challenge 

  The refinery’s R&D division faced three core challenges: 


  - Traditional assays took far too long. 

  - Multiple expensive instruments, skilled personnel, and continuous
  maintenance were required. 

  - Crude properties can shift from shipment to shipment, but slow lab methods
  made it difficult to detect changes in real time. 


  Despite strong laboratory expertise, the team needed a modern approach that
  could maintain laboratory-grade accuracy while improving speed. 


  ## A Practical Step Toward Digital Transformation 

  In 2021, when the refinery partnered with Rombo AI, their objective was
  straightforward: accelerate blending and trading decisions and reduce
  logistical bottlenecks – without compromising precision. 


  During early collaboration sessions, their R&D laboratory teams explained the
  scenario and that a solution capable of compressing analytical timeframes
  would have an immediate, measurable impact across the refinery. 


  To address these issues, we/Rombo AI deployed the **NMR AI Analyzer**, a
  benchtop low-field NMR system enhanced with machine-learning models trained on
  the refinery’s own laboratory results. 


  The Analyzer leverages low-field NMR spectra and deep learning algorithms to
  estimate over 40 crude oil properties simultaneously, including API gravity,
  sulfur content, TAN, viscosity, and distillation yields across multiple
  boiling ranges. 

  Once installed, operators could perform a complete assay with a simple
  three-step workflow: 


  1. Prepare a sample using a standardized mix (≈10 minutes) 

  2. Insert it into the NMR instrument (≈5 minutes) 

  3. Generate a full AI-driven assay report (seconds) 


  This shift replaced weeks of complex testing with a single, automated,
  high-precision process. Moreover, non-technical laboratory staff was able to
  fully utilize the technology, enabling the team to scale crude oil analysis
  without relying on specialized expertise. 


  ## Results 

  **1. Full assays delivered in 15 minutes** 


  The NMR AI Analyzer successfully analized over 40 crude oil properties
  simultaneously, including API gravity, sulfur content, TAN, viscosity, and
  distillation yields across multiple boiling ranges. Through this information,
  the refinery gained the ability to compare, select, and validate crude oils on
  the same day, enabling faster commercial and operational decisions. 


  **2. ~90% reduction in analytical workload**


  Tasks previously requiring multiple instruments and specialists were
  consolidated into one automated system. 


  **3. Greater visibility into crude variability**


  The team can now run more frequent assays, capturing fluctuations that were
  previously invisible due to lengthy and expensive traditional workflows. 


  **4. Laboratory-level accuracy**


  Machine-learning models met the refinery’s internal accuracy benchmarks,
  delivering results aligned with ASTM/ISO practices. 


  ## Conclusion 

  We were glad to successfully complete this project for our overseas client. In
  just 12 months, we were able to demonstrate how integrating AI with low-field
  NMR can modernize refinery analytics and deliver immediate business impact,
  without requiring major changes to laboratory infrastructure.
